This notebook implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify animals based on their features using the "Zoo.csv" dataset. It includes steps for data importing, preprocessing (such as removing duplicates), and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with count plots to visualize the feature distributions. The notebook then builds and evaluates the KNN model to predict the animal types.
